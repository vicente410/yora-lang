# Yora
This project is now archived. This is due to many reasons. I have since learned a lot more about many other amazing programming languages and many other awesome ideas. Implementing a new language with these new ideas would almost be making a project from scratch. Work at university is also back after the summer, so time is not as plenty. The project did serve its purpuse. It is a turing complete language. I learned a lot about programming languages and desinging them. I also worked with a collegue giving him directions and teaching him ideas, improving the ability to work as a team and to communicate. The current version of Yora is neither fast nor full of features, but it is a concept and a stepping stone towards future and better projects. I look forward to them.
